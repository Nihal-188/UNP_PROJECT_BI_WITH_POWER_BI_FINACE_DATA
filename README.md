# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_FINANCE_DATA

Completed this project as part of my Value added course Mastering BI with PowerBi with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

In this project, I utilized Microsoft Power BI to create an interactive financial data dashboard that provided clear, actionable insights through in-depth analysis. Each dashboard was complemented by a detailed insights summary, offering strategic guidance for informed decision-making. This project highlights my expertise in managing financial data, crafting compelling visualizations, and delivering valuable business insights.
